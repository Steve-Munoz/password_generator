# password_generator

For this project I created a password generator, but to organize my thoughts, I went through the rigorous git flow branches process. I first created my html document and filled it with the necessary content and made sure to have bootstrap linked. I then created a css file. I decided to use while loops to prompt the user for password criteria. I then started on my javascripot file and first created all my variables. I created an If statement to prevent the user from answering all the password criteria questions as false. I used DOM to add the password to my html document and used a function to generate the password. Overall proccess was alot, but it helps to seperate each step and work on that first and then go step by step and testing it before moving on to the branch for your set of code.
